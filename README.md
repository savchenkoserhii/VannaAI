# Grocery Inventory and Sales Dataset Analysis with Vanna AI

This project utilizes the **Vanna AI** library to automatically generate SQL queries using natural language and analyze data from the **Grocery Inventory and Sales Dataset**.

## Description

This project uses a dataset containing information about grocery inventory and sales. With **Vanna AI**, users can ask questions in natural language, and the model automatically generates the corresponding SQL queries to analyze data in a PostgreSQL database.

The project includes sample queries to extract analytics such as:

- The top 5 best-selling products and their current stock status.
- Total inventory value by category.
- Products that are critically low on stock.
- Products with expiring dates within the next 30 days.
- Inventory turnover performance by category.
- Product status by conditions (e.g., products that need to be reordered).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Vanna AI library
- PostgreSQL or compatible database
- API keys for Vanna AI and OpenAI (if using OpenAI models)
